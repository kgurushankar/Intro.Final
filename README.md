# Tower Defense 

## Introduction 
We will be creating a tower defense style game which involves a map, moving enemies, and towers. The player will be able to place towers by using a currency system to buy new towers. Defeating enemies adds currency to the users bank, allowing them to buy more towers and progress through the game. There are several classes of towers that do different types of attacks and have different effects on enemies.
