## Introduction 
We created a stategy tower defense game which involves a map, moving enemies, and towers. The player will be able to but new towers by using a currency system. Defeating enemies adds currency to the users bank, allowing them to buy more towers and progress through the game. There are several classes of towers that do different types of attacks and have different effects on enemies. 
### The target audience
Primarily children and people who enjoy playing games on the computer
### Features
* Load maps from a file
## How to play 
You choose a tower and place it on a place other than on the path. Once the tower is placed the amount it cost will be deducted from your account. You will only need a mouse. The tower will automatically attack the enemy once the round starts. After all the rounds have been completed you can place more towers. The goal is to prevent less than 20 enemies from getting to the end of the path
### Classes
We are going to be implementing towers and enemies using classes. We have not yet determined the number of classes, but they will be noted here. It is likely that we will be introducing a basic tower which fires a single projectile at a moderate speed, range, and RPM, a tower that deals Area of Effect (AOE) damage at a low RPM and high range,  and a tower that has short range but deals high damage to multiple enemies at once with a low RPM.
